🛒 E-Commerce Customer Analysis & Clustering

🚀 Welcome to the E-Commerce Customer Analysis & Clustering Project! 🚀

This project generates synthetic e-commerce transaction data, performs market basket analysis using the Apriori algorithm, and applies K-means clustering to segment customers. It also provides interactive 3D visualizations for deeper insights. 📊🔍

📌 Features

✅ Synthetic Data Generation: Creates realistic e-commerce transaction data using Faker.
✅ Market Basket Analysis: Implements the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets & association rules.
✅ Customer Segmentation: Uses K-means clustering to group customers based on purchasing behavior.
✅ 3D Interactive Visualizations: Generates dynamic 3D plots for association rules & customer clusters.
